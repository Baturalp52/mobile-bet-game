# Mobile Bet Game Project

## A fully functional Mobile Bet Game Project written in Kotlin

Mobile Bet Game is a mobile application that leverages a sports API to provide users with real-time information on current day's matches. Users can browse through the main screen to view matches and select the ones they are interested in. Upon selecting a match, a bet panel opens, allowing users to view the odds and place bets on the chosen match.

### Features
* Live Match Data: Fetches real-time data from a sports API to display current day's matches.
* Bet Placement: Users can select a match and place bets using the bet panel.
* My Bets Screen: Displays a list of the user's played bets along with the final odds.
* Balance Management: Users can play bets with a preferred amount of money from their balance.
* Outcome Check: At the end of the day, the application automatically checks the user's bets against the new data and marks them as either a win or a loss.
